# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
My own rendition of a hand-written digit classifying 'Neural Network' - made from scratch in Python. This model is trained on and utilizes the MNIST dataset (database of handwritten digits with a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples).

This is a simple 'Dense Neural Network' hosting data preproccessing, forward propagation, back propragation, error calculations and code to navigate through outputs. 
Made solely in Python from scratch - I.E no dedicated 'Machine learning' libraries like TensorFlow or Pytorch. This is merely mathematics translated onto a computer using matplotlib and NumPy.

I have also added in commments to explain much of the code, to serve as a guide to not only understanding this project but to also serve as an introduction to deep learning with neural networks.
